- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rhysj92
- 👀 I’m interested in old story driven RPGs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning very slowly. Have a baby on the way and I potentially have some learning issues.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I don't know enough and don't want to waste people's time.
- 📫 How to reach me on here I guess.
